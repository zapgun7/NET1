## Building and Running
- Open the VS solution, and build the server and client projects in x64 Debug or Release
- Find the built exe's, and copy the welcomemats.txt over to the folder they're in (the server needs it)
- Run the server exe first, then as many (within reason) clients as you want!
- All controls are explained in the program
    


## Issues to Watch Out For
- Word wrap works with user input, but if changing the screen size does anything to the current user input (its wordwrap), it'll break (only visually)
- Clicking somewhere in the console will not allow the user to input, right click anywhere in the window to undo this
